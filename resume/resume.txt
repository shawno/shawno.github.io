Senior Software Developer - E-commerce
Mountain Equipment Co-op - Vancouver, BC
March 2013 - March 2015

I help MEC build and maintain various digital properties and apps.

I am a firm advocate for usability, and the comprehensive member experience across all MEC digital properties.

In my first quarter I piloted the development effort on the rebranding of MEC.ca using a heavily customized build of Twitter Bootstrap. This launched smoothly to over four million members, coinciding with the complete rebranding of MEC in September 2013. Throughout the project I collaborated closely with our design and content teams, providing interaction design and usability guidance - particularly for touch, mobile, and tablet.
