EMPLOYMENT

Front-End Web Development Team Lead
Mountain Equipment Co-op - Vancouver, BC
March 2015 - Present

I lead the front-end development team for a number of MEC's digital properties including the ecommerce store, MEC.ca.

In my first year in the role I executed several initiatives to increase developer throughput, improve code maintainability, and deliver a consistent brand experience:

- Pioneered the first MEC digital style guide, and pattern lab. This allows front-end web development to scale exponentially, leveraging code and design decisions across the brand, for a uniform experience in less time.
- Drove the adoption and organizational education on Atomic Design principles.
- Reinvented the design and development workflow, focussing on rapid, collaborative prototyping in code, over designing static comps in Photoshop.
- Created the first MEC Web Performance Budget: a set of targets for page load times, and corresponding metrics around user-perceived page speed.
- Instituted a multi-tiered browser, OS, and mobile device support model.
- Built and managed the Front-End development team from a sole developer, to a team of 6 developers, plus myself.
- Managed code repositories and the Gitflow branching strategy, making for highly robust repos.


Senior Software Developer - E-commerce
Mountain Equipment Co-op - Vancouver, BC
March 2013 - March 2015

I help MEC build and maintain various digital properties and apps.

I am a firm advocate for usability, and the comprehensive member experience across all MEC digital properties.

In my first quarter I piloted the development effort on the rebranding of MEC.ca using a heavily customized build of Twitter Bootstrap. This launched smoothly to over four million members, coinciding with the complete rebranding of MEC in September 2013. Throughout the project I collaborated closely with our design and content teams, providing interaction design and usability guidance - particularly for touch, mobile, and tablet.
